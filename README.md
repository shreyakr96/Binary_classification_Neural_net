# Binary_classification_Neural_net
This program finds the most optimal neural network architecture to perform binary classification.
Instead of starting out with a large number of nodes and pruning away the unnecessary nodes, it constructively adds neurons as and when required, in a pyramidal structure. 

The details of how to use this algorithm are provided in the file titled 'Pyramidal neural network'
